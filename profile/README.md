### **What is AligneAI?**

AligneAI has a distinctive approach to model deployment and data privacy. We specialise in offering AI models like LLMs and text Embedding models, including equivalents to the widely recognised ChatGPT, but with a key difference: we use open source models that are designed to operate within your private workspace on our secure cloud platform. Additionally, with AligneAI you will be able to wrap your model interactions with toxic content identification, data privacy, and your requirement specific guardrails ensuring safe and secure use of AI.

### **Our Offerings**

- **Private Workspace Deployment**: Your AI models run in an isolated environment, ensuring that your data never leaves your control.
- **Open Source Models**: Full access to the model's source code, allowing for customisation and transparency.
- **Scalable AI Solutions**: From small projects to enterprise-level deployments, our platform scales with your needs.
- **Dedicated Support**: Expert assistance to help you integrate and optimise AI models for your specific requirements.

### **Benefits of Using AligneAI**

- **Enhanced Privacy and Security**: With models deployed in your private workspace, sensitive data is processed securely, without the risks associated with shared model environments.
- **Customisation and Control**: Access to open source models allows for customisation, enabling you to tailor AI solutions to perfectly fit your business needs.
- **Cost-Effective Scalability**: Pay for what you use without the overhead of managing physical infrastructure, allowing you to scale your AI capabilities as needed efficiently.
- **Comprehensive Compliance**: Easier compliance with data protection regulations, as data processing and storage are confined to your controlled environment.

### **How We Differ From OpenAI / ChatGPT**

While OpenAI provides proprietary AI models via a shared platform, AligneAI emphasises privacy, customisation, and control by offering open-source models deployed in your private workspace. This approach not only enhances data security but also provides the flexibility to modify and adapt AI models to suit your specific requirements, all while maintaining a scalable and cost-effective cloud infrastructure.
